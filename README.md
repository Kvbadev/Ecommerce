This is a project to learn a new javascript framework (at least for me) - Svelte. Besides that I'm also going to improve my present knowledge of C# and dotnet framework.
The project posesses of backend and frontend, everything in on repository. For authorization, I use jwt tokens and will use refresh tokens in future.
