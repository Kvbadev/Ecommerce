The project includes all important aspects of an ecommerce web application, such as authentication, payments, persisting shopping cart and integration with google openID. I started the project to improve my existing programming skills, especially in .net and backend in general, but also to learn completely new things, such as svelte and Azure. You can check out how the project performs by visiting https://ec2-52-59-237-24.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:50001/, where the entire thing is up and running. Project's frontend is not really responsive, so I'd recommend to check the page on a monitor.
All available routes are in Web/WebUI/src/routes.ts file.
